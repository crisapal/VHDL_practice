# VHDL_practice


A repository for Electrical Engineering Students who are stuck in learning hardware synthesis languages.

Most of the sources included in this repository come with a testbench for those of you who are not able to work on a FPGA Device. For the others, you can test these sources on either Basys3 or Nexys4 from Digillent.
